## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier

## Overview
In this project, I used a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. 
## Dataset Summary & Exploration

#### 1. A basic summary of the data set. 

  Number of training examples = 34799  
  Number of testing examples = 12630                                                                                                   
  Number of validating examples = 4410   
  Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)   
  Number of classes = 43

## Design and Test a Model Architecture

Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. 

## 1. Pre-process the Data Set
As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale.

```python
X_test_gry = np.sum(X_test/3, axis=3, keepdims=True)
X_train_gry = np.sum(X_train/3, axis=3, keepdims=True)
X_valid_gry = np.sum(X_valid/3, axis=3, keepdims=True)
```
Then, i normalize my data so that it has mean zero and equal variance. For image data, i used (pixel - 127.5)/ 127.5 as way to approximately normalize my data. 

```python
new_X_train = (X_train_gry - 127.5)/127.5
new_X_valid = (X_valid_gry - 127.5)/127.5
new_X_test =  (X_test_gry - 127.5)/127.5
```

#### The original images is not balanced, so i will generate additional data

#### Images generator
In order to tackle the problem of umbalanced data set, i've set 2000 as a fixed number of examples for each class. For that, i have used some techniques and geometric transformations, thanks to OpenCV2, such as translation, rotation and affine transformation.   

```python
for class_n in range(n_classes):
    class_indices = np.where(y_train == class_n)
    n_samples = len(class_indices[0])
    if n_samples < 2000:
        for i in range(2000 - n_samples):
            input_indices.append(class_indices[0][i%n_samples])
            output_indices.append(new_X_train.shape[0])
            new_img = new_X_train[class_indices[0][i % n_samples]]
            new_img = random_translate(random_scaling(random_warp(random_brightness(new_img))))
            new_X_train = np.concatenate((new_X_train, [new_img]), axis=0)
            y_train = np.concatenate((y_train, [class_n]), axis=0)
```

## 2. Model Architecture

My final model Inspired by LeNET consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 Gray image   							| 
| Convolution 2D     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 28x28x6 	|
| Activation					|	Tanh											|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 				|
| Convolution 2D      	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 10x10x16 	|
| Activation					|	Tanh											|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16			     	|
| Flatten             | outputs 400
| Convolution 2D     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 1x1x400 	|
| Activation					|	Tanh											|
| Flatten              | outputs 400                   |
| Concat       | Inputs = 400 + 400, Outputs = 800 |
| DropOut   	      	| keep Prob 			                |
| Fully connected		| outputs 43        				    		|

## 3. Train, Validate and Test the Model

### Train mode parameters

In retrain model, the parameters as follows:    
* learning rate = 0.0009
* optimizer = Adam    
* batch size = 64    
* max epochs = 100

```python
Training...

EPOCH 1 
Validation Accuracy = 0.896
Train Accuracy = 0.921

EPOCH 2 
Validation Accuracy = 0.929
Train Accuracy = 0.968
 ....
EPOCH 98 
Validation Accuracy = 0.974
Train Accuracy = 1.000

EPOCH 99 
Validation Accuracy = 0.978
Train Accuracy = 1.000

EPOCH 100 
Validation Accuracy = 0.979
Train Accuracy = 1.000

```
And this is a graph that shows the evolution of the validation accuracy :

![png](./index6.png)

My final model results were:   
* Train Accuracy = 1.000  
* Validation Accuracy = 0.979    
* Test Accuracy = 0.965     

Firstly, I choose a pretrained model like VGG16, because it is classic way to use transfer learning but i have found that it is easyly overfitting. Then, i decided to choose another model which is LeNET in my case and make some adjustments by adding or taking away some layers, i've changed the activation function. I found that generating new samples and having a balanced data helped me improve accuracy. Finally, i've tuned my hyperparameters.    
  
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.    
 Avoid overfitting, I add dropout layers after two conv layers. I choose Relu function as activation function to avoid vanishing gradient.     
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?    
  I tune learning rate to 0.0001 in finetue model. Because reducing learing rate can make the loss function to minimum instead of oscillating back and forth.    
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?    
 Dropout and L2 regularization are very important. These design choices can avoid overfitting.    

## 5、Analysis Error Images

 Through the following picture, we known the images which have a shadow or over exposure lead to accuracy lowly.    
```
    The number of incorrectly predict labels is 153

## Test a Model on New Images

Here are 8 German traffic signs that I found on the web with the result of prediction:

![png](./index13.png)

    The first and the second image might be difficult to classify because of their similarities with other traffic signs.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------| 
| Stop                  | Stop                    			     		| 
| Speed limit (50km/h)  | Speed limit (50km/h)  						|
| Road work         	| Road work         							|
| Turn left ahead  		| Turn left ahead		    	 				|
| Speed limit (120km/h)	| Speed limit (120km/h) 							|
    
The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of 98.79%       

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

 ```
  For the first image, the model rightly predicts Stop sign(probability of 1), and the image does contain a Stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were:

    * P1: 0.000000 - No entry
    * P2: 0.000000 - Road work
    * P3: 0.000000 - Speed limit (20km/h)

```
![jpg](./writeup_img/predict_4.jpg)
```
For the fourth image, the model is sure that this is a Turn left ahead sign (probability of 1), and the image does contain a Turn left ahead sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

    * P3: 0.000000 - Go straight or left
    * P4: 0.000000 - Go straight or right
```

```
For the fifth image, the model is sure that this is a Speed limit (120km/h) sign (probability of 1), and the image does contain a Speed limit (120km/h) sign. The top five soft max probabilities were    
    * P0: 0.999934 - Speed limit (120km/h)
    * P1: 0.000066 - Speed limit (20km/h)
    * P2: 0.000000 - Speed limit (70km/h)
    * P3: 0.000000 - Keep left
    * P4: 0.000000 - Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited
```
